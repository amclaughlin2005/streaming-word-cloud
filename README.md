# üìä Streaming Word Cloud

A real-time word cloud visualization web application that reads from local CSV files and dynamically updates as your data changes. Perfect for live feedback, social media monitoring, survey responses, or any text data you want to visualize.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-time Updates**: Automatically checks your CSV file for changes every 5 seconds
- **Beautiful UI**: Modern, responsive design with gradient backgrounds and smooth animations
- **Smart Filtering**: Automatically removes common stop words and short words
- **Interactive**: Hover over words to see their frequency count
- **Customizable**: Easy to modify word filtering and styling
- **Mobile Friendly**: Responsive design works on all devices

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- A CSV file with text data

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone <your-repo>
cd streaming-word-cloud
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Your CSV File

1. Create a CSV file with text data in the `data/` directory
2. The app comes with a sample file: `data/sample_data.csv`
3. You can replace it with your own data or create a new file

### 3. Set Up Authentication

The app now includes Clerk authentication to protect your data:

1. **Copy the environment template:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Sign up for Clerk (free tier available):**
   - Go to [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com)
   - Create a new application
   - Copy your Publishable Key and Secret Key

3. **Configure your .env file:**
   ```
   CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_publishable_key_here
   CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_secret_key_here
   CSV_FILE_PATH=data/your_data.csv
   PORT=3000
   ```

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
npm start
```

Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`

**First time setup:** You'll be prompted to sign in through Clerk. You can use email/password, Google, or other supported providers.

## üìù Usage

### Preparing Your CSV File

The application reads all text from your CSV file and creates a word cloud. You can:

- Use any number of columns with text data
- Add new rows anytime - the app will automatically detect changes
- Mix text with other data types (numbers will be filtered out)
- Use headers or no headers - both work fine

### Example CSV Structure

```csv
feedback,comments,notes,category
"Great service!","Very helpful staff","Quick response","positive"
"Excellent quality","Would recommend","Outstanding support","positive"
"Needs improvement","Could be better","Average experience","neutral"
```

### Customizing Word Filtering

The application automatically filters out:
- Common English stop words (the, and, is, etc.)
- Words shorter than 3 characters
- Pure numbers
- Punctuation

To customize the filtering, edit the `STOP_WORDS` set in `server.js`.

## üé® Customization

### Styling

Modify `public/styles.css` to change:
- Colors and gradients
- Font sizes and families
- Layout and spacing
- Animations and transitions

### Word Cloud Parameters

Edit `public/wordcloud.js` to adjust:
- Word cloud dimensions
- Color schemes
- Font size ranges
- Rotation angles
- Update intervals

### Backend Processing

Modify `server.js` to change:
- CSV file path and processing logic
- Text processing algorithms
- API endpoints
- Polling intervals
- Error handling

## üîß API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Main application page
- `GET /api/clerk-config` - Returns Clerk configuration
- `GET /api/wordcloud-data` - Returns processed word cloud data (requires authentication)
- `GET /api/question-types-data` - Returns question types analysis (requires authentication)
- `GET /api/sentiment-data` - Returns sentiment analysis (requires authentication)
- `GET /api/health` - Health check endpoint

**Note:** All data endpoints now require valid authentication tokens.

## üì± Browser Support

- Chrome 60+
- Firefox 55+
- Safari 12+
- Edge 79+

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Authentication Setup Required" message**
   - Make sure you've copied `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Verify your Clerk keys are correctly set in the `.env` file
   - Check that your Clerk application is properly configured

2. **"Failed to load data" error**
   - Check that your CSV file exists at the specified path
   - Verify the CSV_FILE_PATH in your .env file is correct
   - Ensure the CSV file is properly formatted
   - Check file permissions (make sure the app can read the file)
   - Make sure you're signed in (authentication required)

3. **Empty word cloud**
   - Verify there's text data in your CSV file
   - Check that your CSV file isn't empty
   - Ensure at least some columns contain text (not just numbers)

4. **File not updating**
   - Make sure you're editing the correct CSV file
   - Check the polling interval in your .env file
   - Restart the server if changes aren't being detected

5. **Sign-in issues**
   - Clear your browser cache and cookies
   - Check that your Clerk publishable key is valid
   - Verify your Clerk application settings in the dashboard

### Debug Mode

Set `NODE_ENV=development` to see detailed error logs:

```bash
NODE_ENV=development npm start
```

## üîí Security Notes

- **Authentication Required**: All data endpoints are now protected with Clerk authentication
- **Secure Session Management**: User sessions are managed securely through Clerk
- **CSV files are stored locally** and only accessible to authenticated users
- **Data processing happens locally** on your machine
- **Environment Variables**: Keep your `.env` file secure and never commit it to version control
- **HTTPS Recommended**: For production deployments, use HTTPS to protect authentication tokens
- Consider file permissions if using sensitive data
